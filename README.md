This project is a data structure and algorithm implementation in Python that utilizes linked lists, arrays, and hash maps to manage shop price lists and recipes. The main goal of this project is to efficiently organize and retrieve information to find the cheapest price list possible and manage recipes effectively.

## Features

- **Price List Management**: Organize shop price lists efficiently using linked lists and hash maps for quick retrieval.
- **Recipe Management**: Save and manage recipes using arrays to store ingredients and their quantities.
- **Cheapest Price List Finder**: Algorithm to find the cheapest combination of items across multiple shops for a given recipe.
- **User Interface**: A simple command-line interface to interact with the system.
